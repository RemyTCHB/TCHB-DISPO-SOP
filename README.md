TCHB Dispositions Team Dashboard

A real-time, secure, and collaborative workflow tracking application custom-built for the Total Cash Home Buyers (TCHB) Dispositions team.

Enterprise-Grade Security:

Google OAuth Authentication.

Backend Firestore Security Rules prevent unauthorized read/write access.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript

Backend / Database: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL Document Database)

Authentication: Firebase Auth (Google Provider)

Hosting: Vercel (Continuous Deployment via GitHub)

🔒 Security & Firebase Configuration

To ensure the safety of company data, this application relies on both frontend routing and backend database rules.

1. Authorized Domains (Frontend Security)

To allow the Google Sign-in popup to function, the hosting domains must be whitelisted in the Firebase Console:

Navigate to Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Settings -> Authorized Domains.

Add your live domains (e.g., app.[YOUR_DOMAIN].com, localhost).

2. Firestore Security Rules (Backend Security)

Even if the frontend code is inspected, the database is physically locked down. The following rules are deployed in Firestore to guarantee only authorized personnel can read or modify data:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      // ONLY allow access if logged in WITH an authorized company email address
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email.matches('.*@[YOUR_DOMAIN][.]com');
    }
  }
}


🚀 Deployment (Vercel)

This application is designed to be hosted seamlessly on Vercel.

Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.

Ensure the primary HTML file is named index.html in the root directory.

Vercel will automatically deploy on every push to the main branch.

Note: Ensure the final production domain provided by Vercel (or your custom domain) is added to the Firebase Authorized Domains list.

📋 SOP Blueprint Structure

The application hard-codes the standard operating procedure (SOP) into three main phases:

Phase I: Deal Intake (10%)

Phase II: Marketing Prep (40%)

Phase III: Marketing Execution (50%)

Tasks are automatically assigned to default agents (Carlos, Sarah, Moe, Yanna) upon asset creation, but can be dynamically reassigned live within the active tracker.

🗑️ Asset Deletion

To permanently remove an asset from the pipeline, users must click the deletion button at the bottom of the Active Deal Tracker and enter the required authorization password ([REDACTED_PASSWORD]).
